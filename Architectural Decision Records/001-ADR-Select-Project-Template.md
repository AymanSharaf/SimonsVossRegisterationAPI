# Selecion process for project template

## Context and Problem Statement

Choose project template which to help save as much time as possiple while showcasing advanced topics

## Considered Options

* Jason taylor's template <https://github.com/jasontaylordev/CleanArchitecture>
* Steve Smith's tamplete <https://github.com/ardalis/cleanarchitecture>
* ABP.io <https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest>

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "ABP.io" becasue dev team is familiar with the frameweork and it will provide a huge advantage while applying DDD concepts without the need to implement too many boilerplate code.
Not: Cleaning the layered project template from Multi-tenancy code + permissions and other uneeded modules will take some time but it'll be paied off when the actual development starts.
